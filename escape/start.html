    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    You are a cyber security engineer at the company TruSec. You are tasked with identifying a hacker responsible for a major hack of a local school's student database. They have access over 1000 students usernames and passwords and will leak them in 60 minutes. It is your job to find out who is responsible and turn them in before the passwords get leaked!
    <br><br>
    We have narrowed down the origin of the attack coming from the domain petcs.club/escape/____. We are missing the final digits of the URL, but we managed to recover a hint the hacker uses to remember the link. Can you figure out what the URL is?
